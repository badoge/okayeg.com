<p>This game is a variation of a "15" puzzle. Your goal is to assemble the picture by moving pieces around using an empty space.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>
<img src="/example/puzzle.webp" alt="Example - Puzzle" />
<div class="divider"></div>

<p>
  Click on a cell to slide it into the free space. Or flick it with a swipe, if you're using a touch screen.
  <br />
  Elements can only be swapped horizontally or vertically into the free space. Puzzle pieces cannot be swapped with each other directly.
</p>

<p>
  Each run is evaluated by two criteria: how fast and how efficient you managed to solve the puzzle. You can try to speedrun the game by using less time and clicking faster, or take more
  time - but solve the game in less actions (swaps).
</p>

<p>
  Check out the <i>settings menu</i> if you need to amp up the accessibility for the game.
